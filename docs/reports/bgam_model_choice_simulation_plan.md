## Monte Carlo Repetition Plan

The current `B_k1612_ps` run took `37.50` wall-clock hours using `16` CPUs, or about `600` CPU-hours per fit. Based on this runtime and the current SSH job limits, a feasible Monte Carlo plan is:

```text
20 Monte Carlo repetitions, with at most 5 full BGAM jobs running at the same time.
```

## Interpretation

The full BGAM repetitions should be used for the main recovery and false-positive results.

Cheaper proxy checks can still be run with many more seeds, for example `100-1000`, to test specific mechanisms such as coloured temporal noise, spatial asymmetry, and basis-size sensitivity. These proxy checks do not replace the full BGAM; they explain whether the observed behaviour is systematic across many random seeds.
